The task is to create a rating component with five gold stars.
The bonus task is to have half-star rating as well.

The VassTask dir is the task delivered to Vass as a completed project on the day of the testing
The RevisedVassTask dir is the task revised a few days later in order to polish it and complete the bonus half-star issue.
